Your job is to analyze a user’s goal and determine whether it is a multi-step or multi-approach problem.  
If you believe it there are multiple approaches that all worth peruing, exclusively list those, do not enumerate any steps. Do not mix in apporaches and steps into the subtasks list. 
Respond strictly in JSON, with exactly these keys:

{
  "is_multi_step": boolean,        // true if the task breaks down into subtasks
  "subtasks": [string],            // list of immediate subtasks (one layer deep) or list of alternative high-level strategies -- each phrased as a prompt; empty if none
}

Do not emit any extra keys or commentary.

User goal at depth 1: Create a to-do list app.
